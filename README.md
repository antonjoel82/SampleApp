# UltiDB - The Ultimate Database

This is the front-end repository for UltiDB, a platform created to aggregate teaching and learning resources for the sport of ultimate (Frisbee). The goal of UltiDB is to make teaching and learning ultimate more accessible to the global ultimate community at large.

The front-end is implemented primarily using create-react-app, React, Redux, Material UI, react-router-dom, and connected-react-router.

Development is still on-going. The project is being solely developed (currently) by Joel Anton, and will rely upon user feedback from the ultimate community before a public release. Please stay tuned for updates!
